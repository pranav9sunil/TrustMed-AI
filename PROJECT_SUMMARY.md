# Project Summary: RAG System Evaluation & Optimization

## Work Completed

### 1. Answer Generation Improvements ✅
- **Longer Answers**: Increased from 2 sentences to 4-6 sentences with bullet points
- **Professional Tone**: Removed "friendly" fillers, no markdown bolding
- **Link Separation**: Links now stored separately in `chat_history.json` for frontend handling
- **Context Switching**: Verified across 15-query test sequence (100% success)

### 2. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework ✅
- **Test Coverage**: 34 queries across multiple dimensions
  - 15 single-turn queries (easy/medium/hard difficulty)
  - 3 edge cases (medical abbreviations: DM, HTN, CAD)
  - 16 conversational queries (5 different flows)
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Retrieval Quality (similarity scores)
  - Keyword Match (ground truth)
  - Context Accuracy (conversational flows)
  - System Performance (latency)
  - Topic-based analysis
  - Difficulty-based analysis

### 3. Phase 1 Optimizations Implemented ✅
**Changes to `anti_test.py`:**
```python
# Improved Thresholds
X0: 0.68 → 0.75  (+10% more selective)
Y0: 0.50 → 0.60  (+20% higher floor)
T_META0: 0.35 → 0.40  (+14% stricter)

# Reduced Iterations
AGENT_MAX_ITERS: 3 → 2  (-33% iterations)
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Latency reduced by 12% (28.2s → 24.8s)
- ✅ Context accuracy improved to 94%
- ✅ Edge case handling: 100%

## Current System Performance

### Overall Health Score: 0.67 / 1.00

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Context Accuracy**: 0.94 (94%) ⭐ Excellent
- **Keyword Match**: 0.87 (87%) ⭐ Very Good
- **Retrieval Quality**: 0.21 (normalized from 0.45) ⚠️ Needs Improvement

### Performance by Difficulty
- **Easy**: 92% keyword match, 0.600 similarity ✅
- **Medium**: 79% keyword match, 0.413 similarity ✅
- **Hard**: 90% keyword match, 0.214 similarity ⚠️

## Files Created

### Evaluation Framework
1. `evaluation_dataset.json` - Initial 11-query test set
2. `evaluation_dataset_extended.json` - Extended 30+ query test set
3. `evaluate_system.py` - Basic evaluation script
4. `evaluate_system_comprehensive.py` - Full evaluation suite

### Test Results
5. `evaluation_report_20251127_134448.txt` - Initial baseline results
6. `comprehensive_evaluation_report_20251127_153803.txt` - Full evaluation results
7. `comprehensive_evaluation_results_20251127_153803.json` - Machine-readable data

### Testing Scripts
8. `test_context_switch.py` - 5-query context switching test
9. `run_full_conversation_test.py` - 15-query conversation test
10. `full_conversation_test_log_20251124_093021.txt` - Test output

## Git Commits

1. **Commit 1**: "Refactor answer generation: longer answers, separate links in chat_history.json, and context switching test"
2. **Commit 2**: "Phase 1 optimizations and comprehensive evaluation"

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

### Phase 2: Medium-Term Improvements
1. **Fix Asthma Coverage** (Priority: High)
   - Current: 40% keyword match
   - Action: Verify knowledge base has asthma data
   - Target: 80%+ keyword match

2. **Resolve Context Switch Edge Case** (Priority: High)
   - Issue: 1/16 conversational queries failed (Diabetes→Heart Disease)
   - Action: Adjust context window weighting
   - Target: 100% context accuracy

3. **Implement Query Expansion** (Priority: Medium)
   - Add medical synonym expansion
   - Handle abbreviations better
   - Target: +15% retrieval quality

### Phase 3: Long-Term Enhancements
1. **Result Caching**
   - Cache common queries
   - Target: <1s for cached results

2. **Reranking Model**
   - Add cross-encoder for final ranking
   - Target: +0.15-0.20 retrieval quality

3. **Fine-tune Embedding Model**
   - Train on medical Q&A pairs
   - Target: +0.10-0.15 similarity
